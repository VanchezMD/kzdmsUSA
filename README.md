I always loved one particular car manufacturer so I made this website that let's you rent most thrilling vehicles from this car manufacturer portfolio

## Important info
You need to create dummy account to "rent out" cars

## How to check it out
If you don't like to install random projects from github just [click here](https://car-rental-with-django.herokuapp.com/) but you need to know that the hosting is free so the app is freezed when no one is physically on the website hence long loading times.


## If you wanna install this project
```powershell
virtualenv env
env\Scripts\activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
python manage.py migrate
python manage.py runserver
```
