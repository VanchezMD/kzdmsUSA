# car-rental-with-Django

This app is finally up, you can check it out at https://car-rental-with-django.herokuapp.com/

This is a car rental project made with Django | Chart.js | Jquery | Bootstrap 4 and stripe.js payments
I always loved one particular car manufacturer so I made this website that let's you rent this brands cars. 
!(all the logos used in this project are owned by Mercedes-Benz and are used only for testing purposes)!

To run this project you need to install all the dependencies in requirements.txt
In further releases the gallery will be added and the picture will be changed becouse some have wrong size
